# singapore_map

Took way too long to create! Obviously inspired by the original Berlin map created by u/vinnivinnivinni, but I was also inspired by the recent Paris map created by u/hlake and by his usage of D3.
This one was created using D3, the publicly available map of Singapore though slightly modified to account for recent opening of four stations (Mothership.SG, Soruce: http://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/smrt-map.jpg) and a tracing of the actual metro line (JohoMaps, Source: http://johomaps.com/as/singapore/singaporemetro.jpg). I have the JS code with all the points in it, happy to share if anyone is interested.
